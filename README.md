# MUST Hotel Booking

MUST Hotel Booking is a WordPress hotel-booking and operations plugin. It manages accommodations, availability, pricing, guest reservations, payments, refunds, staff workflows, email notifications, and optional Clock PMS synchronization from one plugin.

## Project status

- Current code and release tag: `0.4.90`.
- Runtime: WordPress plugin; metadata declares PHP 7.4+, but current code practically requires PHP 8 until compatibility is reconciled.
- Status: active development with substantial local, Stripe, PokPay, Clock PMS, admin, staff-portal, and Elementor functionality.
- Readiness: **not proven production-ready**. The repository audit records unresolved critical confirmation access-control and paid-payment/Clock-fulfillment recovery risks. See [Project Context](docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md) and the temporary [Repository Consolidation Plan](docs/REPOSITORY_CONSOLIDATION_PLAN.md).

## Main capabilities

- Managed public booking, accommodation selection, checkout, confirmation, and guest cancellation flows.
- Local and Clock-backed availability, quoting, reservation, synchronization, and amendment workflows.
- Stripe Checkout, PokPay SDK checkout, opt-in Pay at Hotel, refunds, and Clock deposit-folio accounting.
- WordPress admin workspaces for reservations, payments, rooms, pricing, availability, guests, email, reports, settings, and diagnostics.
- Capability-gated staff portal at `/staff` with login at `/staff-login`.
- Elementor booking search, room list, and room text-grid widgets.
- GitHub release updater and release-package workflow.

## Requirements

- WordPress 5.0 or later.
- PHP 8 in practice. The plugin header currently declares PHP 7.4, but active payment, email, and portal paths use PHP 8-only string helpers.
- Pretty permalinks for staff portal routes.
- Provider credentials and callback URLs only when the relevant integration is explicitly enabled.

The header/readme requirements are distribution metadata, but they currently conflict with executable PHP usage. Treat both PHP 7.4 support and WordPress versions newer than the recorded tested-through value as unverified until compatibility tests pass.

## Local installation

1. Place this directory at `wp-content/plugins/must-hotel-booking`, or install a canonical release ZIP.
2. Activate **MUST Hotel Booking** in WordPress.
3. Open **MUST Hotel Booking → Settings** and review hotel identity, booking rules, managed pages, payments, email, staff access, and provider mode.
4. Save permalinks if `/staff` or managed-page routing returns 404.
5. Test the full booking lifecycle in a non-production environment before enabling public traffic.

Activation installs or upgrades plugin tables, creates managed pages, synchronizes staff capabilities, schedules WP-Cron hooks, and flushes rewrite rules. Do not activate against an unsnapshotted production database as an informal test.

## Safe development checks

Run from the plugin root:

```powershell
git status --short
php -l path\to\changed-file.php
php tests\PaymentPublicCheckoutPolicyTest.php
php tests\ProviderDataSanitizerTest.php
git diff --check
```

The standalone tests vary in strength; some inspect source markers and do not prove concurrency or database behavior. The WordPress-loaded E2E harness and provider preflight tools have different side-effect boundaries. Read [Operations](docs/OPERATIONS.md) before running them.

## Production and provider warning

Do not run provider probes, callback tests, Clock sync, booking/payment/refund E2E, cleanup scripts, deployment, or production-data operations without explicit approval, a verified non-production target where applicable, and a current backup. Browser return data is not authoritative payment proof.
